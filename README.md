# Game Of War

The goal of this project is to create an app for a card game called War. The main activity of the game will be a game called War. 
The secondary activity will use SQL or SQLite to keep track of and display the wins and losses for players of the game. There 
will be a preferences page of the app; this page will allow users to control aspects of the app, such as the names of players 
and the colors displayed by the app. A help page will explain the preferences page of the app as well as how to play the game.

I have completed the main activity of the app and the secondary activity of the app. Using war.zip, you can use an emulator with 
android studio to run the app.
